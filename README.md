# Code-Basics

My sollutions from https://ru.code-basics.com/.

## What is Code Basics?
It is a completely free platform to learn the basics of programming from scratch. Code Basics was created by the developers and the Hexlet community so that anyone could try their hand at programming and lay the right foundation for a new profession, based not on memorizing the specifics, but on understanding the system as a whole.

## What opportunities are there for practicing developers?
Code Basics is an open source project. Any practicing developer can participate in its development. The source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/hexlet-basics). You can help create new courses and lessons, improve existing ones, correct inaccuracies and typos, and translate courses into English.
